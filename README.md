 Project Overview: "MyCash" Mobile Financial Service
 
This is a desktop application (built with Java Swing) that simulates a mobile banking system similar to apps like bKash or Nagad.

Key Features:
i.Users can Register and Login.
ii.Customers can Send Money, Cash Out, and Cash In.
iii.Agents receive requests and approve Cash Out/Cash In transactions.
iv.Bank (Admin) acts as the authority to approve "Add Money" requests for Agents.
v.All data is stored in a MySQL database, and the app uses real-time constraints (e.g., you can't send money if your balance is low).
